# NetPulse  
*A Python-based network monitoring and anomaly detection tool with trust scoring and VirusTotal API implentation*

---

## ðŸš€ Overview  
NetPulse is a lightweight, Python-based **network monitoring tool** that detects new devices, MAC spoofing attempts, and anomalies on a local subnet. It assigns a **dynamic trust score** to each device using configurable JSON policies, helping analysts quickly identify potentially suspicious behavior.  

Think of it as a **mini SIEM for your LAN**, it collects logs, applies scoring logic, highlights anomalies, and stores scan history for audit and review.

## ðŸ”‘ Features  
- **Live Monitoring** â€“ Continuously scans the local subnet for connected devices.  
- **Change Detection** â€“ Flags new devices, MAC address changes, and trust score fluctuations in real time.  
- **Trust Scoring Engine** â€“ Assigns a dynamic score to each device based on:  
  - Vendor trustworthiness (configurable in JSON)  
  - Device type classification (e.g., camera, laptop, Intel chipsets)  
  - MAC address validity (spoofed vs. legitimate)  
  - Connection time (business hours vs. off-hours)  
- **Configurable Policies** â€“ External JSON files define scoring rules and trusted vendors for easy customization.
- **VirusTotal API Score** - VirustTotal API custom scoring if provided API key 
- **Color-Coded Alerts** â€“ Terminal output highlights anomalies and low-trust devices for quick triage.  
- **Scan History** â€“ Maintains a full history of previous scans for review.  
- **CSV Logging** â€“ Exports scan results and trust scores for audits or further analysis.  
- **Lightweight & Portable** â€“ Runs in any Python 3.x environment with minimal dependencies.
